## Links

* Live Example - https://robhitt.github.io/taboola-2
* Github - https://www.github.com/robhitt/taboola-2

## Installation

* Fire up the index.html file in any web browser and you'll be good to go!
  * If running locally on line 51 in the JS you will need to make the `sourceURL` static by hard coding `window.location.href`
  * Note: As a result of CORS issues w/ the latest version of Chrome if running locally try on Firefox, Safari, or Opera. Otherwise [once deployed](https://robhitt.github.io/taboola-2) the application works perfectly on Chrome
